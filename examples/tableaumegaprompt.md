# Mega Prompt | Tableau's Future

## Context and Goal
You need to identify and analyze occupations or roles in which 50% or more of the work time is spent using Tableau. You want to understand how these roles will evolve over the next 1, 3, and 5 years, especially in light of advances in AI, Generative AI (GenAI), technology trends, and changing user experience demands. This analysis should be **broken down by region** and should include **data-enabled forecasts with numerical predictions**, supplemented by **qualitative insights from industry experts and thought leaders**.

---

## 1. List of Relevant Occupations (≥50% Tableau Usage)

1. Identify the **specific job titles, roles, or occupations** where Tableau usage (data visualization, dashboard development, analytics) constitutes at least 50% of total work time.  
2. **Explain why** these roles require such a heavy emphasis on Tableau (e.g., typical tasks, level of seniority, core responsibilities).

---

## 2. Current State of These Occupations

1. Provide an **overview of scope and responsibilities** for each role.  
2. Include **approximate salary ranges**, **typical experience/education requirements**, and the **industries** where these roles are commonly found.  
3. Identify the **key skills** besides Tableau that are crucial today (e.g., data cleaning, data modeling, business communication).

> **Regional Context:**  
> - Break down any differences in salary ranges, educational requirements, and common industries by major regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, etc.).  
> - Highlight notable regional trends (e.g., a higher demand in certain industries or countries).

---

## 3. Prognosis by Time Horizon (1, 3, and 5 Years)

For each occupation:  
1. **Analyze how the role is likely to change** in 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years.  
2. Discuss how **AI, GenAI, new analytics tools, and evolving user expectations** (self-service, embedded analytics, natural language queries, etc.) will impact these roles.  
3. Indicate which **tasks might be automated or augmented** by AI/GenAI, and which tasks will remain uniquely human (e.g., interpretive storytelling, stakeholder engagement).

> **Data-Driven Forecasts:**  
> - Provide **numerical predictions** (e.g., percentage of tasks automated, expected salary growth, job market demand indices) over each time horizon.  
> - Support these with **qualitative insights** from industry experts where available.

---

## 4. Percent of Roles Surviving “As Is” vs. Evolving

1. **Estimate the percentage** of these Tableau-heavy jobs that will continue **with little or no major change** over each time horizon (1, 3, 5 years).  
2. **Estimate the percentage** that will **transform significantly** (adopting new tools, merging into broader analytics/data science roles, or seeing job descriptions drastically altered).  
3. Provide a **range or forecast (in %)** to show how reliant on Tableau (vs. new technologies) these roles will be in 1, 3, and 5 years.

> **Regional Context:**  
> - Note if certain regions are more likely to see higher or lower rates of transformation (e.g., regions with rapid tech adoption vs. those with slower adoption).

---

## 5. Paths for Career Evolution and Required Learning

1. For each role, suggest **realistic career path options** (e.g., pivoting into data engineering, business intelligence leadership, AI/ML roles, data product management).  
2. Identify **critical new skills or certifications** (e.g., Python, R, cloud platforms, AI/ML fundamentals, advanced analytics, prompt engineering for GenAI, user experience design) that will help an individual transition from a Tableau-heavy position into emerging roles.  
3. Provide **recommended resources** (online courses, certifications, communities, mentors) to facilitate this career growth.

> **Data-Driven Insight:**  
> - Where possible, include **industry or market data** indicating which skills have the highest demand growth rates regionally.

---

## 6. User Experience and Interdisciplinary Collaboration

1. Analyze how improvements in **user experience (UX)** — including no-code/low-code analytics solutions, natural language or AI-driven query — will affect the **demand for dedicated Tableau specialists**.  
2. Describe how professionals will increasingly **collaborate across data, AI, and business teams**, and the **soft skills** (communication, presentation, leadership) that will become more critical.

> **Qualitative Insights:**  
> - Cite viewpoints from **industry experts** on evolving collaboration models and the importance of holistic skill sets (technical + interpersonal).

---

## 7. Summary and Actionable Insights

1. Conclude with **key takeaways** that highlight the most urgent changes likely to occur in **Tableau-centric occupations**.  
2. Provide **actionable steps** for current Tableau practitioners (e.g., what to learn next, what roles might fit best, and how to protect against job obsolescence).

> **Call to Action:**  
> - Summarize **immediate steps** vs. **longer-term strategies** (1-year vs. 5-year planning) for staying relevant in a rapidly changing tech environment.

---

## 8. Format and Style

1. Present findings in **well-structured sections** or bullet points, clearly organizing the responses under each heading.  
2. **Cite any data sources or references** if you make predictions based on known research or market trends.  
3. Use **concise, clear language** but provide **sufficient detail and depth**.

---

### Important Considerations
- **Global vs. Regional:** Break down the analysis by **major regions** and note significant differences.  
- **Data-Driven + Qualitative Insights:** Combine **numerical predictions** with **expert commentary**.  
- **Generative AI Focus:** Highlight how **GenAI** (content generation, code generation, automated insights) may impact day-to-day Tableau workflows and how practitioners can **adapt**.  
- **Tangible Steps:** Emphasize the **“so what?”** factor: how individuals can **actively shape their careers** rather than passively waiting for changes to happen.
